I did have a question. My original implementation did the 20% order increase before subtracting the leftover food, which returns a different order amount. The current implementation will return a an order amount of 0lbs if the food_needed is less than or equal to the leftover_food without accounting for the 20% buffer. I might suggest swapping the calculation to make sure the 20% buffer is always there. Would it not make sense to do the 20% addition prior to the leftover_food removal?
